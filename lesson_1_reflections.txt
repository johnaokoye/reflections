Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Setting up a repository.

How did viewing a diff between two versions help spot the bug.
It only showed me the changes that were made in the new version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 

It could spead up the process of revertin back to the last
working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

When you choose when to create a commit you have more flexibility. This allows you to 
make sense of and keep track of your changes more easily.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows multiple files in one commit because one change can include multiple files.
In Google Docs changes usually affect only one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will show the log of commits with decscriptions and git diff can compare the changes made in
files accross different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert to a previous goo
